Python Practice

This repository contains Python practice scripts created as part of my learning journey while transitioning from Software QA to AI.

Each script focuses on mastering core Python concepts such as variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and error handling.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `number_guessing_game.py` | A simple CLI game to guess a randomly generated number, built to practice conditionals, loops, and user input handling |
| `rock_paper_scissors.py` | A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. |
| `time_counter.py` | A simple time counter based on the input(seconds) given by the user |
| `NumberFrequency.py` | A Program to count number of times a number repeated in a input sequence, One of the logic needed in Data wrangling in AI/ML |
| `ReverseString.py` | A Program which reverses the input string, One of the logic needed in Data wrangling in AI/ML |
| `RemoveNonAlphaNumericChars.py` | A Program which removes non alphanumeric characters from the input string, One of the logic needed in Data wrangling in AI/ML |
| `PasswordValidator.py` | A Program which validates the user password, One of the logic needed in Cyber security |
